# Customer_churn_prediction
 
In this comprehensive project, I propose an exploration into the realm of Machine Learning Algorithms to address the critical challenge of predicting customer churn within the telecom industry. The primary objectives include the entire data science spectrum, from rigorous data gathering and preprocessing to the theoretical foundations and practical applications of essential algorithms. The project will begin with the gathering of an adequate dataset related to customer churn, which will necessitate the use of advanced preprocessing techniques to assure data quality. Following that, I will dive into the implementation of various statistical ML algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. with a meticulous focus on comprehending, fine-tuning, and evaluating their performance using relevant metrics. 
In this project, I will be focusing on both theoretical analysis and practical approach. A thorough examination of the mathematical and statistical foundations of the selected algorithms will be conducted, along with that I am researching their advantages, disadvantages, and key characteristics. Simultaneously, I will apply these algorithms to the preprocessed dataset, aiming to build a predictive model for customer churn. The ultimate goal is not just the development of a functional model but also a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing customer churn, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making in the telecom industry. I am planning to implement various algorithms on the same data set and will provide a detail comprehensive analysis of each algorithm's results. 

The algorithms that I propose to use are:
1)	SVM 
2)	Logistic Regression
