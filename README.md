# Customer_churn_prediction
 
In this comprehensive project, I propose an exploration into the realm of Machine Learning Algorithms to address the critical challenge of predicting customer churn within the telecom industry. The primary objectives include the entire data science spectrum, from rigorous data gathering and preprocessing to the theoretical foundations and practical applications of essential algorithms. The project will begin with the gathering of an adequate dataset related to customer churn, which will necessitate the use of advanced preprocessing techniques to assure data quality. Following that, I will dive into the implementation of various statistical ML algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. with a meticulous focus on comprehending, fine-tuning, and evaluating their performance using relevant metrics. 
In this project, I will be focusing on both theoretical analysis and practical approach. A thorough examination of the mathematical and statistical foundations of the selected algorithms will be conducted, along with that I am researching their advantages, disadvantages, and key characteristics. Simultaneously, I will apply these algorithms to the preprocessed dataset, aiming to build a predictive model for customer churn. The ultimate goal is not just the development of a functional model but also a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing customer churn, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making in the telecom industry. I am planning to implement various algorithms on the same data set and will provide a detail comprehensive analysis of each algorithm's results. 

# The algorithms that I propose to use are:

1)	SVM 
2)	Logistic Regression

# Introduction

Customer attrition is one of the biggest problems and top worries for big businesses. Due to the direct effect on business profits, especially in the telecommunication sector, businesses are trying to create techniques to anticipate possible client attrition. Thus, identifying the causes of customer attrition is essential to taking the appropriate steps to lower it. 

The main focus of our extensive study is implementing machine learning methods, specifically aiming to tackle the crucial problem of telecom industry - customer churn prediction. We start by addressing the critical challenge of predicting customer churn and recognize the importance of overcoming the obstacles associated with this predictive task. Our study emphasizes the importance of advanced preprocessing techniques in order to conduct a robust and accurate analysis. The exploration of various Statistical Machine Learning Algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression is part of our research methodology.

Each algorithm is chosen for its distinct characteristics and potential application to customer churn prediction. The research delves into the intricate details of each algorithm, analyzing, fine-tuning, and assessing its success in predicting the churn. To assess the efficacy of these algorithms, we use confusion metrics, a broad set of evaluation metrics that includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Conclusion

In this project, we explored diverse algorithms - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. The importance of a comprehensive strategy in addressing customer churn is emphasized. Actionable insights for businesses to tailor effective retention strategies are provided. The importance of this type of research in the telecom market is to assist companies in increasing their profits. Predicting the churn has become one of the most important sources of revenue for telecom companies [1]. Using the modern machine learning algorithms for statistical analysis will be better. It helps the company know their customers better and work towards satisfying their needs. The main reason behind customers leaving a service provider and joining a new one, is the availability of better offers. If the company can predict the customer requirements in advance, then they will be able to retain them. According to studies it shows that the cost of acquiring a new customer is 25% higher than retain an existing customer. So, if the telecom companies use the predictive analysis they will be able to lower their revenue costs and spend the saved money on development.

Lastly, we acknowledge the ongoing significance of machine learning in customer relationship management. The Machine Learning Models can be used for predictive analysis to know which factors affect customer attrition rates. In the modern competitive telecommunication business, itâ€™s very important to know factors that could lead to losing a customer and working towards retaining them. It a highly competitive market and focusing on promising factors can help the company strive in the business.
